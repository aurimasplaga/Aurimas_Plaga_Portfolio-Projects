## Healthcare Demographic & Cost Analysis:

**‚ùìQuestion Answered: How do patient demographics (age, gender, and blood type) influence hospital costs and interactions with insurance providers?**

**üéØ Goal:** This project analyzes patient demographics, healthcare costs, and insurance claims to uncover key trends affecting hospital and clinic billing. The aim is to identify high-cost groups, improve resource allocation, and develop targeted preventive care strategies.

**üìÑ Description:** Using a dataset of patient records, this analysis explores the relationships between age, gender, blood type, and healthcare costs. The project provides insights into admission types, severity distribution, and insurance provider trends. Findings help optimize resource allocation, improve hospital efficiency, and develop targeted care programs for high-risk groups.

**üõ† Skills Used:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Dataset Cleaning
* SQL for Data Querying
* Power BI for Visualization

**üìà Results:** 

* **Demographics Directly Impact Costs:** Age, gender, and blood type significantly influence hospital billing, severity of cases, and insurance claim distribution.
* **Older Patients & Males Drive Higher Costs:** Patients aged 60+ and males incur higher medical expenses due to severe conditions and longer hospital stays.
* **Chronic vs. Acute Conditions:** Chronic diseases like arthritis & obesity are more common in females, while males and older adults suffer from acute conditions like sepsis, TBI, and cancer.
* **Blood Type Influences Costs:** O+ and A+ patients dominate healthcare usage, while rare blood types (AB+, B-) face higher costs per patient due to severe cases.
* **Hospitals vs. Clinics:** Hospitals handle severe and high-cost cases, while clinics manage routine and chronic conditions.
* **High-Cost Insurance Providers:** UnitedHealthcare & Medicare dominate claims, while Cigna has fewer claims but the highest average billing.

**üìå Key Recoomendations:**
* **Demographic-Specific Strategies:** Allocate more resources to high-cost groups (elderly, males, rare blood types) while enhancing preventive care for younger adults and females.
* **Preventive Care Focus:** Target younger adults for injury prevention, middle-aged adults for chronic disease management, and males for trauma reduction.
* **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Increase hospital capacity for severe cases, strengthen clinic support for chronic care, and create specialized programs for high-cost demographics.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Develop integrated healthcare data systems to predict high-risk claims and optimize care delivery.
