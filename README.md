# Aurimas Plaga Portfolio Projects


# About

My name is Aurimas. I have a background in organic and analytical chemistry, and I am currently on track to learn Data Analytics at Turing College. I love what a data analyst does and am passionate about utilizing data to uncover valuable insights and solve complex problems.

During my career in chemistry, I gained familiarity with various types of analytical methods, which has helped me develop a strong foundation in data interpretation and problem-solving. I’m now eager to transition these analytical skills into a more data-centric field, applying them to uncover meaningful patterns and trends in data.

Though I’m still relatively new to data analytics, I am a fast learner who thrives on adapting to new methods and gaining deeper insights with each passing day. Whether working independently or collaborating with others, I am driven by curiosity and the excitement of uncovering meaningful patterns in data to solve challenges.

# Portfolio Projects

## [Healthcare Demographic & Cost Analysis:](https://github.com/aurimasplaga/Healthcare_demographic_analysis)

**❓Question Answered: How do patient demographics (age, gender, and blood type) influence hospital costs and interactions with insurance providers?**

**🎯 Goal:** This project analyzes patient demographics, healthcare costs, and insurance claims to uncover key trends affecting hospital and clinic billing. The aim is to identify high-cost groups, improve resource allocation, and develop targeted preventive care strategies.

**📄 Description:** Using a dataset of patient records, this analysis explores the relationships between age, gender, blood type, and healthcare costs. The project provides insights into admission types, severity distribution, and insurance provider trends. Findings help optimize resource allocation, improve hospital efficiency, and develop targeted care programs for high-risk groups.

**🛠 Skills Used:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Dataset Cleaning
* SQL for Data Querying
* Power BI for Visualization

**📈 Results:** 

* **Demographics Directly Impact Costs:** Age, gender, and blood type significantly influence hospital billing, severity of cases, and insurance claim distribution.
* **Older Patients & Males Drive Higher Costs:** Patients aged 60+ and males incur higher medical expenses due to severe conditions and longer hospital stays.
* **Severity and Aging:** Severe conditions like cancer and sepsis become increasingly common with age, while traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are more prevalent among younger adults.

* **Chronic vs. Acute Conditions:** Chronic diseases like arthritis & obesity are more common in females, while males and older adults suffer from acute conditions like sepsis, TBI, and cancer.
* **Blood Type Influences Costs:** O+ and A+ patients dominate healthcare usage, while rare blood types (AB+, B-) face higher costs per patient due to severe cases.
* **Hospitals vs. Clinics:** Hospitals handle severe and high-cost cases, while clinics manage routine and chronic conditions.
  
  > ![Scatter Point Chart](https://github.com/aurimasplaga/Healthcare_demographic_analysis/blob/main/Dashboards/Scatter%20Point%20Chart.png)
* **High-Cost Insurance Providers:** UnitedHealthcare & Medicare dominate claims, while Cigna has fewer claims but the highest average billing.

**📌 Key Recomendations:**

* **Demographic-Specific Strategies:** Allocate more resources to high-cost groups (elderly, males, rare blood types) while enhancing preventive care for younger adults and females.
* **Preventive Care Focus:** Target younger adults for injury prevention, middle-aged adults for chronic disease management, and males for trauma reduction.
* **Optimized Resource Allocation:** Increase hospital capacity for severe cases, strengthen clinic support for chronic care, and create specialized programs for high-cost demographics.
* **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Develop integrated healthcare data systems to predict high-risk claims and optimize care delivery.

## [AdventureWorks Multi-Year Business Analytics:](https://github.com/aurimasplaga/AdventureWorks-Multi-Year-Business-Analytics)

**🎯 Goal:** This project analyzes key performance indicators (KPIs) across sales, products, and regional markets using the AdventureWorks database. The aim is to provide data-driven insights into quarterly performance, sales trends, product profitability, and regional market dynamics over a three-year fiscal period. The project was conducted as part of the learning process during studies of data analytics in Turing College.

**📄 Description:** Leveraging AdventureWorks sales data, this analysis explores quarterly revenue trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. The project includes four dashboards: **Quarterly Performance Overview, Sales Insights, Product Analytics**, and **Regional Sales Analysis**. These dashboards help identify high-performing products, track sales efficiency, and uncover market trends to support strategic decision-making and business growth.

**🛠 Skills Used:**

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* SQL for Data Querying
* Power BI for Visualization

**📈 Results:** 

- **Sales Trends:** Overall revenue has grown steadily, with notable quarterly and monthly variations. For instance, Year 2 Q1 recorded high revenue despite a dip in profit, suggesting rising costs.
- **Profitability:** Year 1 Q2 had the highest profit, while other quarters showed significant profit declines, indicating potential cost pressures.
 
  > ![Quarterly Profits](https://github.com/aurimasplaga/AdventureWorks-Multi-Year-Business-Analytics/blob/main/Dashboards/Quarterly%20Profits.png)
- **Sales Channels & Performance:** Offline transactions (87.9% of orders) dominate, and sales are highly concentrated among top performers—the top 5 salespeople contribute over 66% of total revenue.

  > ![Pareto Chart](https://github.com/aurimasplaga/AdventureWorks-Multi-Year-Business-Analytics/blob/main/Dashboards/Pareto%20Chart.png)
- **Product & Category Performance:** High-revenue subcategories include Mountain and Road Frames, with Road Bikes leading overall. While top items like the "Water Bottle - 30 oz." and "Fender Set - Mountain" perform well, some apparel items register losses.
- **Geographical Insights:** Key US states such as California and Texas drive sales, and international markets show promising performance, though the US market remains dominant.


**📌 Key Recomendations:**

- **Cost Optimization:** Investigate cost drivers in high-revenue quarters to improve profit margins.
- **Sales Strategy:** Leverage the strength of offline channels while exploring opportunities to boost online sales.
- **Product Focus:** Prioritize high-margin products and reassess product lines with recurring losses.
- **Targeted Marketing:** Concentrate efforts on high-performing regions and support underperforming sales teams with targeted training and resources.

This analysis will be done using SQL for data querying, Python (VADER) for sentiment scoring, and Power BI for visualization.

**📄 Description:** Leveraging AdventureWorks sales data, this analysis explores quarterly revenue trends, product performance, and regional sales distribution. The project includes four dashboards: **Quarterly Performance Overview, Sales Insights, Product Analytics**, and **Regional Sales Analysis**. These dashboards help identify high-performing products, track sales efficiency, and uncover market trends to support strategic decision-making and business growth.
